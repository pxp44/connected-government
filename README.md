Connected Government Plan
==============================

This is just a simple infographicvisualizationpretty kind of thing for our Connected Government Plan (eGov if you will). The strategies graphic was made in Inkscape (source SVG in the assets folder). You can see it live [here](http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/cgplan), and I did a [screencast about it on my blog](http://fuzzytolerance.info/blog/fuzzy-tolerance-28-on-strategic-planning/).

Built with the following awesome:

+ [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
+ [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
